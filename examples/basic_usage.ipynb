    "# Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "`pytket-dqc` is a python package for the distribution of quantum circuits between interconnected quantum computers. Here we gather some basic usage of `pytket-dqc`, covering the main data structures and methods you will encounter. These main data structures include: `NISQNetwork`, the network on which a circuit will be distributed; `Circuit`, describing the circuit to be distributed; `Distribution`, which describes the distribution of a circuit onto a network; and `Distributor`, the parent class for a collection of techniques for generating a distribution."

    "## Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Networks of quantum servers are specified by two properties. The fist is the server coupling, detailing which servers are connected to which others. In `pytket-dqc` this is specified by a list of pairs of integers, where each pair signifies that there is a connection between those two servers. The second is the qubits each server contains. This is specified by a dictionary from the server to a list of qubits it contains. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example is given below, where blue lines indicate connections between servers, and red lines indicate connections between qubits within servers. The vertex labels are the indexes of the qubits."
