    "# Circuit Distribution and Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "`pytket-dqc` is a python package for the distribution of quantum circuits between interconnected quantum computers, which we call modules (or servers). Here we gather some basic usage of `pytket-dqc`, and introduce some basic concepts from distributed quantum computing (DQC). For more extensive discussion on `pytket-dqc` please see the documentation [here](https://cqcl.github.io/pytket-dqc/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main data structures we will discuss include: `NISQNetwork`, the network on which a circuit will be distributed; `Circuit`, describing the circuit to be distributed; `Distribution`, which describes the distribution of a circuit onto a network; and `Distributor`, the parent class for a collection of techniques for generating a `Distribution`. We will also introduce the notions of starting and ending processes, link qubits, detached gates and Steiner trees, as discussed in greater detail in the corresponding paper [Distributing circuits over heterogeneous, modular quantum computing network architectures](link)."

In some cases, embedding allows ebits to survive past Hadamard gates, allowing for their reuse. Consider the below example of the SWAP gate, which can be decomposed as a sequence of CZ gates sandwiched by Hadamard gates. Without embedding each of the 3 CZ gates would require an ebit to be distributed on the simple 2 module network given below. However, the central CZ can be embedded, and the ebit required to implement the first CZ gate remotely can be reused by the third, assuming a correction is made on the embedded portion of the circuit. Further technical details on embedding can be found in [Entanglement-efficient bipartite-distributed quantum computing with entanglement-assisted packing processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12688)"
