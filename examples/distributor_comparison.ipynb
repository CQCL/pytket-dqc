    "# `Distributor` Comparison\n",
    "In `pytket-dqc` a `Distributor` transforms a pytket `Circuit` and a `NISQNetwork` into a `Distribution` describing how, and in which network modules, gates of the original circuit should be acted so as to comply with the connectivity of the network. A `Distributor` is constructed from an `Allocator`, which produces and initial `Distribution`, followed by a sequence of refinements, implemented as instances of the `Refiner` class. In this notebook we will examine some of the default distributors available through `pytket-dqc`. These have been constructed as recommended by the authors, but you may wish to develop your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use terminology that was introduced in the notebook `basic_usage`, and refer you to [Distributing circuits over heterogeneous, modular quantum computing network architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14148) for the fullest discussion of the terminology and methods used. Throughout this notebook we will use the Chemically-Aware Ansatz circuit, used in the results of the above paper and seen below, as a running example."

    "Under the hood, the `CoverEmbedding` `Distributor` uses the `PartitioningHeterogeneous` `Allocator` to construct an initial `Distribution`, keeps only the allocation of qubits to modules, and uses the `VertexCover` `Refiner` to implement non-local gates. However, `VertexCover`, and so `CoverEmbedding`, is designed with homogeneous networks in mind. As such there are no detached gates in the resulting `Distribution`, and each hyperedge contains gates and qubits placed in a maximum of 2 modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for this, we can act a `Refiner` after `CoverEmbedding`. The refinement passes `NeighbouringDTypeMerge` and `IntertwinedDTypeMerge` can be used to merge hyperedges so that they cover more than two modules. The resulting `Distribution` will have a reduced ebit cost due to the use of Steiner trees to distribute entanglement."
