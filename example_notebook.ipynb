    "The current implementation of GraphPartitioning (and, in particular, the refinement algorithm) makes use of a cache to store precomputed costs. For each subset of servers, the cache stores the cost of communicating these servers in an efficient way (finding their Steiner tree in the network). The size of this cache can be toggled using parameter `cache_limit` which establishes a limit on the cardinality of the subsets of servers whose cost will be stored in cache: if the subset has more servers than `cache_limit` then its cost will be computed but not stored in the cache. If there are N servers and m = `max_key_size` then the cache will store up to N^m values. Default value is 5."
